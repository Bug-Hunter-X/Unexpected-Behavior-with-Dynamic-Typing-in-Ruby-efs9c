This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Ruby stemming from its dynamic typing system.  The `bug.rb` file shows how assigning a string to a variable previously holding an integer produces no errors, but this could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior in more complex applications.  The `bugSolution.rb` offers potential solutions and best practices to prevent this type of issue.
